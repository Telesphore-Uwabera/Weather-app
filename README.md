# Weather Application

This is a simple weather application that allows users to check the current weather and the next few hours' forecast for a specific location. Users can input a location, and the application will provide weather-related information such as temperature, description, humidity, wind speed, and more. The application uses data from the OpenWeatherMap API.


## Features

- **Current Weather:** Get real-time weather data for a specific location, including temperature, description, humidity, wind speed, and more.

- **Next Hours Forecast:** View the weather forecast for the next few hours, including temperature and description.

- **Search by Location:** Input the location you want to check, and the application will fetch weather data for that location.
